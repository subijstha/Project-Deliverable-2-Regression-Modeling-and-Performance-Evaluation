# MSCS 634 Project Deliverable 2: Regression Modeling and Performance Evaluation

This project notebook focuses on developing and evaluating regression models for predictive analysis using Python.

## Contents

- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as `bmi_squared` and `age_bmi_interaction` to improve model performance.
- **Regression Models**: Implemented multiple regression models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed models using:
  - R-squared
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Cross-validation scores
- **Visualizations**:
  - Pairplot of key features
  - Residual plot for linear regression predictions

## Visualizations

- **Feature Relationships**: Explores relationships between selected variables to uncover patterns.
- **Residual Analysis**: Assesses the distribution of errors to evaluate model fit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
